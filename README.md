Embedded Systems
This course focuses on using the ATMega328p microcontroller to construct sophisticated embedded systems. Initially, the microcontroller is integrated into an Arduino UNO, and we program the circuits using the 
capabilities of Data Direction Registers and input and output pins. We eventually go on to the real IC chip and create increasingly intricate circuits. This is where the code for each lab is written, along with 
a sample and any relevant images. All principles I've learned come from the lecture slides of Professor McLaughlin and the additional information I've gained from years of programming expertise. C is the language used.
